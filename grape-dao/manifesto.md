# Manifesto

The Grape Community is a group of talented Solana supporters focused on accelerating the adoption and growth of the Solana ecosystem. 

* Bringing more people into the Solana Ecosystem
* Supporting the growth and adoption of Solana projects
* Providing educational materials related to building, using, and investing on Solana

  
To accomplish this, the community has adopted a meritocratic value system where influence and voting are delegated by no one person; those who are contributing the most will have the greatest influence in decision-making.

We’ve chosen to adopt the “Community-First” approach as laid out by Metacartel
