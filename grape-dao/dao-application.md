# DAO Application

You can find the DAO application in Discord

Must have at least one skill role

Must hold a minimum of 20,000 GRAPE

## Skill Roles

Skill Roles are allocated to community members that have shown exceptional talent and contributed to a work request or work group. These roles are grouped into separate sub-DAOs

**How to get a Grape Skill Role:**

The only requirement is to prove ability. At present, this can be done in the Discord _share-your-talent_ channel on the Grape server.

To maintain a skill role through the Grape Epochs, community members will need to actively contribute to each subDAO they have a role for.   
  
Users inactive for 30 days or more will be removed from the Discord and lose their roles. They can return and earn their role at any time.

**Examples of Skill Roles are**

* Designer
* Videographer
* Developer
* Researcher
* Writer
* Moderator
* Translator
* Community Creator
* Region Manager
